# Code-Calender

This project is mainly build for tracking a user's <b>Codeforces</b> and <b>Leetcode</b> calender in a single profile, 
so there is no need to back and forth to each profile and see how was your streak.

1. Analyze Progress: Users can visually track their combined performance across platforms, making it easier to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

2. Improve Coding Skills: By consolidating submissions from multiple coding platforms, users can get a comprehensive view of their coding practice and work on diverse problem sets.

3. Efficient Time Management: Users can manage their coding practice more effectively by viewing their activity over time, helping them allocate their study and practice sessions better.
